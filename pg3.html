        <h1>Structure and Feel</h1>
        <p>For the Time Being is a music-driven science fiction film. It is broken into two main segments: four live-action scenes taking place in a kitchen, each followed by a scene taking place inside the realm of the Being. Each set of scenes will follow a different stage of drug addiction, starting with experimentation and ending with dependency. All of the live-action scenes follow the couple meal prepping and dancing - and through changes in this ritual, we can see how their relationship devolves. An unspecified amount of time will pass between each live-action scene, shown by changes in set, lighting, and costuming. There should be many different subtle changes but no extremely obvious changes.

Even though this film is about the dangers of drug addiction, there will be no overt drug references.
